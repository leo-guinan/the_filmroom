## Technical Decisions to Make

1. **AI Provider**: OpenAI vs Anthropic vs open-source models
2. **Transcription Service**: OpenAI Whisper vs Deepgram vs Assembly AI
3. **Video Storage**: Direct upload to S3 vs LiveKit Cloud recording
4. **Authentication Provider**: Auth0 vs Clerk vs NextAuth.js
5. **Payment Processing**: Stripe vs Paddle (for future subscription handling)
6. **Email Service**: SendGrid vs Postmark vs AWS SES

## Risk Mitigation

1. **LiveKit Complexity**: Start with basic video features, add advanced features incrementally
2. **AI Costs**: Implement usage limits and caching strategies early
3. **Data Privacy**: Design with privacy-first architecture from the start
4. **Scalability**: Use queues for AI processing to handle load spikes
5. **User Experience**: Prioritize coach workflow over feature completeness

## Success Metrics

- **Technical**: <100ms API response time, <2s video connection time
- **User**: >90% session completion rate, <5% technical issue rate
- **Business**: 10 active coaches in first month, 100 sessions completed
- **Quality**: >4.5/5 user satisfaction score

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environment
2. Create initial project structure
3. Implement basic authentication
4. Get simple video call working with LiveKit
5. Build minimal coach dashboard
6. Add basic transcription capability
